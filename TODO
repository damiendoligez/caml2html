- add a -s option which reads the code from the command line

- add "mkdir -p" feature instead of just "mkdir"

- bug in ocaml compiler (3.09.2): -dtypes option on input.mll creates 
  an input.annot file where character counts are higher than what they 
  should be. The number of lines is correct though.
